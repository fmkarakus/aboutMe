               <h2>Is Albania worth visiting?</h2>
               <p><em>Definitely!</em> Although it is small country, it has beatiful scenery, good hotels (not many though), perfect, long beaches, calm waters,
                 culture, friendly, sincere people, history and lots of mountains. There is something for every taste.</p>

             <h2>Is it safe, though?</h2>
             <p>Personally never had a problem. Public security is generally good, particularly in Tirana, and Albanians are very hospitable to visitors.
               Crime and violence does occur in some areas, but reports of crime specifically targeting foreigners are rare.
               Most of the disputes are related to criminal, business or political interests. The crime rate in Albania is even lower than many European countries.(According to this <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/crime-rate-by-country">source</a>)
             </p>

             <h2>Where to go?</h2>
             <p>Alongside the capital of Tirana, Albania has a wealth of towns, cities, and scenic destinations to offer travelers.
               In summer, the destination of choice for many outside the capital is the Albanian Riviera where you can find many deserted beaches to enjoy
               with sometimes just the company of some local fishermen and old bunkers to enjoy.
               The Albanian mountains also provide ample hiking opportunities.</p>
               <p>Undoubtedly, all the places inscribed in the UNESCO Word Heritage Site are worth seeing. In Albania these sites are: Berat, Gjirokastёr and Butrint. As far as Tirana is concerned, opinions are divided. Some people say it is finally the capital, so one could visit it, the other ones think it is a waste of time. Among the other places the picturesquely located Krujë should particularly be distinguished.</p>

             <h2>What language do Albanians speak?</h2>
             <p>Well, they speak Albanian. A unique language with 36 letters. Albanians are very talented about languages. You can easily find some one who can speak english, italian, greek, turkish,russian or spanish. </p>

           <div class="question section">
             <h2>Is Albania stil a communist country? Some recent history, please?</h2>
             <p>Prior to WW2, Albania was a monarchy ruled by a rather unique royal family who fled due to the Fascist Italian occupation of the country in WW2.

Following the defeat of Fascism in 1945, Albania was soon taken over by a Marxist-Leninist government and the country soon became known as the People’s Republic of Albania ruled over with an iron fist by the Stalinist leader called Enver Hoxha.
 </p>
 <p>At that time, it was one of the most closed off and difficult to travel to countries on earth. Despite various elements of Albania being modernized such as culture, education, and industry, the country was dominated by horrific repression that saw countless citizens imprisoned in gulags, tortured, and executed.
 </p>
 <p>In the early 1990s, Communism began to fall apart in Albania. The party that had ruled for almost four decades was replaced by the democratic party. However, the transition from dictatorship to democracy was brought with problems. Promised reforms either didn’t come or failed. In 1997, the Albanian government collapsed as a result of failed investments in pyramid schemes and in-depth corruption.</p>
           <p>In the years since the civil war, Albania has made significant progress and today is a functioning democratic society.</p>

                    <h2>Why is Albania called "Land of Eagles?</h2>
                    <p>Albania is called the “Land of the Eagles” due to the symbol of the country being the black eagle. Under the monarchy, this eagle was topped with a crown. Under communism, it was topped with a golden star. Today it remains just an eagle on a red background, the color of which represents bravery, strength, valor, and bloodshed.</p>
