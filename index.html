          <h1>Hi, my name is Fatih</h1>

          <p>I studied Mathematics in university. I worked for many years as a mathematics teacher and school administator.
            I have also worked in Economics department of a university. I gave lessons and did some academic work there.</p>

          <p>I came to Belgium 3 years ago. During this time, I tried to learn Dutch and followed some bootcamps and IT trainings. </p>

          <p>I am a family man, have two sons. I spend most of my free time with/for my family.
            We like to travel and dicover new places, although we didn't do that so much.</p>

          <p>We lived for many years in Albania. People ask me about traveling there,
              so I prepared a frequently asked questions page for Albania and put some photos</p>
